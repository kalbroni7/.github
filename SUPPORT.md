### :no_good: GitHub Issue

Please keep in mind that **GitHub issue tracker is not a support forum.**

In general, GitHub issue is designed for tracking problems occured in project. A personal question about Marp will prevent Marp team focusing to resolve core issues. Moreover, users whose same problem will become difficult to find out closed issue.

_At GitHub, you should not expect an answer to the question. They would be tagged as [`question` label](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Amarp-team+label%3Aquestion&type=Issues) and even closed in early._
